Clean it frequently.	The Surface Book touchscreen has been coated to make it easier to clean. You don’t need to rub hard to remove fingerprints or oily spots. To avoid scratches, use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the screen. You can dampen the cloth with water or an eyeglass cleaner, but don’t apply liquids directly to your Surface. Don’t use window cleaner or other chemical cleaners on your Surface.	https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/B/1/7B10C82E-F520-4080-8516-5CF0D803EEE0/surface-book-user-guide-EN.pdf		[]	False	[]	171	Surface

Power cord care	**Power cord care**\n\nPower cords, like any other metal wire or cable, can be weakened or damaged if repeatedly twisted or bent in the same spot. Here are some things you can do to keep your power cord from being damaged:\n\n*   Avoid twisting or pinching your power cord.\n*   Don’t wrap your power cord too tightly, especially around the power brick. Instead, wrap it using loose coils rather than tight angles.\n*   Inspect your power cord regularly, especially where it joins the power brick.\n*   Avoid pulling on the power cord when unplugging your Surface. Gently removing the connector from the charging connector can help prevent damage.\n\nFor more info, see [Clean and care for your Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/performance-and-maintenance/clean-and-care-for-your-surface) on Surface.com.	https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/B/1/7B10C82E-F520-4080-8516-5CF0D803EEE0/surface-book-user-guide-EN.pdf	explicitlytaggedheading:power cord care	[]	False	[]	175	Surface
